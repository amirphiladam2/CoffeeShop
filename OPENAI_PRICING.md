# OpenAI API Pricing & Free Tier

## Do You Have to Pay for OpenAI?

**Short answer**: Yes, but new accounts get **free credits** to start!

## Free Credits for New Accounts

When you create a new OpenAI account, you typically receive:
- **$5 in free credits** (as of 2024-2025)
- These credits are valid for ~3 months
- Perfect for testing and development!

With `gpt-3.5-turbo` at **$0.002 per 1K tokens**, $5 gives you:
- ~2.5 million tokens
- ~2,500 conversations (assuming 1,000 tokens per conversation)
- That's a LOT of chats for free! ☕

## Pricing Breakdown

### GPT-3.5 Turbo (What we're using)
- **Input**: $0.50 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $1.50 per 1M tokens
- **Average chat**: ~500-1000 tokens = **~$0.001-0.002 per conversation**

### GPT-4 (Optional upgrade)
- **Input**: $10 per 1M tokens  
- **Output**: $30 per 1M tokens
- **Average chat**: ~500-1000 tokens = **~$0.015-0.03 per conversation**

### GPT-4 Turbo (Better quality, cheaper than GPT-4)
- **Input**: $10 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $30 per 1M tokens

## Cost Example for Your Coffee Chatbot

Let's say you have:
- 100 users per month
- Each user has 5 conversations
- Each conversation uses 800 tokens

**Total tokens**: 100 × 5 × 800 = **400,000 tokens per month**

**Cost with GPT-3.5 Turbo**:
- 400K tokens = $0.40 per month
- **Less than 50 cents per month!** 💰

Even with 1,000 users: ~$4 per month

## After Free Credits Run Out

1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for what you use
2. **No monthly fees**: Just pay for API calls
3. **Automatic billing**: OpenAI charges your card automatically
4. **Set spending limits**: Control your costs in OpenAI dashboard

## Setting Up Billing (Optional)

If you want to continue after free credits:

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add a payment method
3. Set spending limits if desired
4. Monitor usage in the dashboard

**You can set a monthly spending limit** (e.g., $10/month) to avoid surprises!

## Free Alternatives (If Needed)

If you want completely free options, consider:

### Option 1: Hugging Face (Free tier available)
- Some models have free access
- May have rate limits
- Requires more setup

### Option 2: Google Gemini (Free tier)
- Limited free requests
- Good quality
- Need to modify edge function

### Option 3: Local Models (Advanced)
- Run models on your own server
- Completely free but requires significant setup

## Recommendations
